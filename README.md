Overview
The project covers:

NLP tasks using SpaCy (tokenization, lemmatization, entity recognition, stop word removal).
Spam classification using the Naive Bayes Classifier with sklearn.
Demonstrates pre-processing pipelines and machine learning workflows.
Features
Text Preprocessing:

Tokenization
Stop word removal
Lemmatization
Named Entity Recognition (NER):

Detects entities like names, dates, and organizations.
Spam Classification:

Uses a Naive Bayes Classifier to classify messages as spam or ham.
Visualizes accuracy and metrics.
Custom NLP Pipelines:

Extends SpaCy pipelines for specific tasks.
Handling Large Datasets:

Uses the spam.csv dataset for training.
